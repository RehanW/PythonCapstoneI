Finance Calculator app

This is a simple app to help with the calculations of financing. It can either calculate the return on investment
or it can calculate the monthly repayments on a loan. These values are calculate by giving the program inputs like
amount, time span and return or repayment percentages.

This app could be used by any person or a financial advisor to estimate the amount of money that they or their client
will need to repay if they made a loan, or how much intereset they could get if they invest a certain amount of money 
at a certain percentage of return. 

All you need to run the app is IDLE python. There is no executable version that I made for the program to make it installable.
